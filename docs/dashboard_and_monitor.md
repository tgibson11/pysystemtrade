# Web Dashboard

*The dashboard is currently a work in progress - functionality is still being added.*

At the moment, the dashboard provides basic diagnostic "traffic lights" to show status of various system components. The content of the reports is also reproduced.

## Installation

If you have installed all of the Python dependencies listed in the `requirement.txt` file, the web dashboard is ready to be started:

```
cd pysystemtrade/dashboard
python3 app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000/` to view the dashboard. To remap this location or to make it accessible from outside machines (do this at your own peril!) you need to do the following:

- Bash terminal (linux): `sudo ufw allow 5000`
- Add the following parameter to your private_control_config.yaml `dashboard_visible_on_lan: True`
