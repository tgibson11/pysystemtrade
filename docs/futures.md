THIS DOCUMENT IS NOT FINISHED AND CONTAINS MANY GAPS AND 'TO DO'!

This document is specifically about *futures data*. It is broken into three sections. The first, [A futures data workflow](#futures_data_workflow), gives an overview of how data is typically processed. It describes how you would get some data from quandl, store it, and create back-adjusted prices. The next section [Storing futures data](#storing_futures_data) then describes in detail each of the components of the API for storing futures data. In the third and final section [simData objects](#simData_objects) you will see how we hook together individual data components to create a `simData` object that is used by the main simulation system.

Although this document is about futures data, parts two and three are necessary reading if you are trying to create or modify any data objects.

# A futures data workflow

This section describes a typical workflow for setting up futures data from scratch:

1. [Set up some static configuration information](#set_up_instrument_config) for instruments, and [roll parameters](#set_up_roll_parameter_config)
2. Get, and store, [some historical data](#get_historical_data)
3. Build, and store, [roll calendars](#roll_calendars)
4. Create and store ['multiple' price series](create_multiple_prices) containing the relevant contracts we need for any given time period
5. Create and store [back-adjusted prices](#back_adjusted_prices)

In future versions of pysystemtrade there will be code to keep your prices up to date.

<a name="set_up_instrument_config"></a>
## Setting up some instrument configuration

The first step is to store some instrument configuration information. In principal this can be done in any way, but we are going to *read* from .csv files, and *write* to a [Mongo Database](https://www.mongodb.com/). There are two kinds of configuration; instrument configuration and roll configuration. Instrument configuration consists of static information that enables us to map from the instrument code like EDOLLAR.

The relevant script to setup *information configuration* is in sysinit - the part of pysystemtrade used to initialise a new system. Here is the script you need to run [instruments_csv_mongo.py](/sysinit/futures/instruments_csv_mongo.py). Notice it uses two types of data objects: the object we write to [`mongoFuturesInstrumentData`](#mongoFuturesInstrumentData) and the object we read from [`initCsvFuturesInstrumentData`](#initCsvFuturesInstrumentData). These objects both inherit from the more generic futuresInstrumentData, and are specialist versions of that. You'll see this pattern again and again, and I describe it further in [part two of this document](#storing_futures_data). 

Make sure you are running a [Mongo Database](#mongoDB) before running this.

The information is sucked out of [this file](/sysinit/futures/config/instrumentconfig.csv) and into the mongo database whose connections are defined [here](/sysdata/mongodb/mongo_connection.py). The file includes a number of futures contracts that I don't actually trade or get prices for. Any configuration information for these may not be accurate and you use it at your own risk.

<a name="set_up_roll_parameter_config"></a>
## Roll parameter configuration

For *roll configuration* we need to initialise by running the code in this file [roll_parameters_csv_mongo.py](/sysinit/futures/roll_parameters_csv_mongo.py). Again it uses two types of data objects: we read from [a csv file](/sysinit/futures/config/rollconfig.csv) with [`initCsvFuturesRollData`](#initCsvFuturesRollData), and write to a mongo db with [`mongoRollParametersData`](#mongoRollParametersData). Again you need to make sure you are running a [Mongo Database](#mongoDB) before executing this script.

It's worth explaining the available options for roll configuration. First of all we have two *roll cycles*: 'priced' and 'hold'. Roll cycles use the usual definition for futures months (January is F, February G, March H, and the rest of the year is JKMNQUVX, with December Z). The 'priced' contracts are those that we can get prices for, whereas the 'hold' cycle contracts are those we actually hold. We may hold all the priced contracts (like for equities), or only only some because of liquidity issues (eg Gold), or to keep a consistent seasonal position (i.e. CRUDEW is Winter Crude, so we only hold December).

'RollOffsetDays': This indicates how many calendar days before a contract expires that we'd normally like to roll it. These vary from zero (Korean bonds KR3 and KR10 which you can't roll until the expiry date) up to -1100 (Eurodollar where I like to stay several years out on the curve).

'CarryOffset': Whether we take carry from an earlier dated contract (-1, which is preferable) or a later dated contract (+1, which isn't ideal but if we hold the front contract we have no choice). This calculation is done based on the *priced* roll cycle, so for example for winter crude where the *hold* roll cycle is just 'Z' (we hold December), and the carry offset is -1 we take the previous month in the *priced* roll cycle (which is a full year FGHJKMNQUVXZ) i.e. November (whose code is 'X'). You read more in Appendix B of [my first book](www.systematicmoney.org/systematic-trading).

'ExpiryOffset': How many days to shift the expiry date in a month, eg (the day of the month that a contract expires)-1. These values are just here so we can build roughly correct roll calendars (of which more later). In live trading you'd get the actual expiry date for each contract.

*FIXME: not all of these parameters are completed accurately (especially ExpiryOffset and RollOffsetDays): I intend to update it properly for everything I actually trade.*

It might be helpful to read [my blog post](qoppac.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/systems-building-futures-rolling.html) on rolling futures contracts (though bear in mind some of the details relate to my current trading system and do no reflect how pysystemtrade works). 

<a name="get_historical_data"></a>
## Getting historical data for individual futures contracts

Now let's turn our attention to getting prices for individual futures contracts. We could get this from anywhere, but we'll use [Quandl](wwww.quandl.com). Obviously you will need to [get the python Quandl library](#getQuandlPythonAPI), and you may want to [set a Quandl key](#setQuandlKey). 

We can also store it, in principal, anywhere but I will be using the open source [Arctic library](https://github.com/manahl/arctic) which was released by my former employers [AHL](ahl.com). This sits on top of Mongo DB (so we don't need yet another database) but provides straightforward and fast storage of pandas DataFrames.

We'll be using [this script](/sysinit/futures/historical_contract_prices_quandl_mongo.py). Unlike the first two initialisation scripts this is set up to run for a single market. 

By the way I can't just pull down this data myself and put it on github to save you time. Storing large amounts of data in github isn't a good idea regardless of whether it is in .csv or Mongo files, and there would also be licensing issues with basically just copying and pasting raw data from Quandl. You have to get, and then store, this stuff yourself. And of course at some point in a live system you would be updating this yourself.

This uses quite a few data objects:

- Price data for individual futures contracts: [quandlFuturesContractPriceData](#quandlFuturesContractPriceData) and [arcticFuturesContractPriceData](#arcticFuturesContractPriceData)
- Configuration needed when dealing with Quandl: [quandlFuturesConfiguration](#quandlFuturesConfiguration) - this reads [this .csv](/sysdata/quandl/QuandlFuturesConfig.csv) and defines the code and market; but also the first contract in Quandl's database (*FIXME: these values aren't defined except for Eurodollar*)
- Instrument data (that we prepared earlier): [mongoFuturesInstrumentData](#mongoFuturesInstrumentData)
- Roll parameters data (that we prepared earlier): [mongoRollParametersData](#mongoRollParametersData)
- Two generic data objects (not for a specific source):  [listOfFuturesContracts](#listOfFuturesContracts), [futuresInstrument](#futuresInstrument)
 
The script does two things:

1. Generate a list of futures contracts, starting with the first contract defined in [this .csv](/sysdata/quandl/QuandlFuturesConfig.csv) and following the *price cycle*. The last contract in that series is the contract we'll currently hold, given the 'ExpiryOffset' parameter.
2. For each contract, get the prices from Quandl and write them into Mongo DB.

<a name="roll_calendars"></a>
## Roll calendars

We're now reading to set up a *roll calendar*. A roll calendar is the series of dates on which we roll from one futures contract to the next. It might be helpful to read [my blog post](qoppac.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/systems-building-futures-rolling.html) on rolling futures contracts (though bear in mind some of the details relate to my current trading system and do no reflect how pysystemtrade works).

You can see a roll calendar for Eurodollar futures, [here](/data/futures/roll_calendars_csv/EDOLLAR.csv). It is just a pandas DataFrame. On each date we roll from the current_contract shown to the next_contract. We also see the current carry_contract; we use the differential between this and the current_contract to calculate forecasts for carry trading rules.

There are two ways to generate roll calendars:

1. Generate an [approximate calendar](#roll_calendars_from_approx) based on the 'ExpiryOffset' parameter, and then adjust it so it is viable given the futures prices we have from the [previous stage](#get_historical_data).
2. Infer from [existing 'multiple price' data](#roll_calendars_from_multiple). [Multiple price data](/data/futures/multiple_prices_csv) are data series that include the prices for three types of contract: the current, next, and carry contract (though of course there may be overlaps between these). 

<a name="roll_calendars_from_approx"></a>
### Approximate roll calendars, adjusted with actual prices

This is the method you'd use if you were starting from scratch, and you'd just got some prices for each futures contract. The relevant script is [here](#/sysinit/futures/rollcalendars_from_arcticprices_to_csv.py). Again it is only set up to run a single instrument at a time. 

In this script:

- We get prices for individual futures contract [from Arctic](#arcticFuturesContractPriceData) that we created in the [previous stage](#get_historical_data)
- We get roll parameters [from Mongo](#mongoRollParametersData), that [we made earlier](#set_up_roll_parameter_config) 
- We calculate the roll calendar `roll_calendar = rollCalendar.create_from_prices(dict_of_futures_contract_prices, roll_parameters)`
- We do some checks on the roll calendar, for monotonicity and validity (these checks will generate warnings if things go wrong)
- If we're happy with the roll calendar we [write](#csvRollCalendarData) our roll calendar into a csv file 

#### Calculate the roll calendar

The actual code that generates the roll calendar is [here](#/sysdata/futures/roll_calendars.py)

The relevant part is:

```python
approx_calendar = _generate_approximate_calendar(list_of_contract_dates, roll_parameters_object)
adjusted_calendar = _adjust_to_price_series(approx_calendar, dict_of_futures_contract_prices)
adjusted_calendar_with_carry = _add_carry_calendar(adjusted_calendar, roll_parameters_object)
```

So we first generate an approximate calendar, for when we'd ideally want to roll each of the contracts, based on our roll parameter 'RollOffsetDays'. However we may find that there weren't *matching* prices for a given roll date. A matching price is when we have prices for both the current and next contract on the relevant day. If we don't have that, then we can't calculate an adjusted price. The *adjustment* stage finds the closest date to the ideal date (looking both forwards and backwards in time). Finally we add the carry contract on to the roll calendar - this isn't used for back adjustment but we still need it for forecasting using the carry trading rule.


#### Checks

We then check that the roll calendar is monotonic and valid.

A *monotonic* roll calendar will have increasing datestamps in the index. It's possible, if your data is messy, to get non-monotonic calendars. Unfortunately there is no automatic way to fix this, you need to dive in and rebuild the  (this is why I store the calendars as .csv files to make such hacking easy).

A *valid* roll calendar will have current and next contract prices on the roll date. Since this is how we generate the roll calendars they should always pass this test (if we couldn't find a date when we have aligned prices then the calendar generation would have failed with an exception).

#### Write CSV prices

Roll calendars are stored in .csv format [here](/data/futures/roll_calendars_csv/EDOLLAR.csv). Of course you could put these into Mongo DB, or Arctic, but I like the ability to hack them if required.

<a name="roll_calendars_from_multiple"></a>
### Roll calendars from existing 'multiple prices' .csv files

In the next section we learn how to use roll calendars, and price data for individual contracts, to create DataFrames of *multiple prices*: the series of prices for the current, forward and carry contracts; as well as the identify of those contracts. But it's also possible to reverse this operation: work out roll calendars from multiple prices.

Of course you can only do this if you've already got these prices, which means you already need to have a roll calendar: a catch 22. Fortunately there are sets of multiple prices provided in pysystemtrade, and have been for some time, [here](#/data/futures/multiple_prices_csv). These are copies of the data in my legacy trading system, for which I had to generate historic roll calendars, and for the data since early 2014 include the actual dates when I rolled.

We run [this script](#/sysinit/futures/rollcalendars_from_providedcsv_prices.py) which by default will loop over all the instruments for which we have data in the multiple prices directory.

# Storing futures data

The paradigm for data storage is that we have a bunch of [data objects](#generic_objects) for specific types of data, i.e. futuresInstrument is the generic class for storing static information about instruments. Each of those objects then has a matching *data storage object* which accesses data for that object, i.e. futuresInstrumentData. Then we have [specific instances of those for different data sources](*specific_data_storage), i.e. mongoFuturesInstrumentData for storing instrument data in a mongo DB database. 


<a name="generic_objects"></a>
## Futures data objects and their generic data storage objects

<a name="futuresInstrument"></a>
### [Instruments](/sysdata/futures/instruments.py): futuresInstrument() and futuresInstrumentData()

Futures instruments are the things we actually trade, eg Eurodollar futures, but not specific contracts. Apart from the instrument code we can store metadata about them. This isn't hard wired into the class, but currently includes things like the asset class and so on.

<a name="contractDate"></a>
### [Contract dates](/sysdata/futures/contract_dates_and_expiries.py): contractDate()

Note: There is no data storage for contract dates, they are stored only as part of [futures contracts](#futuresContracts).

A contract date allows us to identify a specific [futures contract](#futures_contract) for a given [instrument](#futuresInstrument). Futures contracts can eithier be for a specific month (eg '201709') or for a specific day (eg '20170903'). The latter is required to support weekly VIX contracts. A monthly date will be represented with trailing zeros, eg '20170900'.

We can also store expiry dates in contract dates. This can be done eithier by passing the exact date (which we'd do if we were getting the contract specs from our broker) or an approximate expiry offset, where 0 (the default) means the expiry is on day 1 of the relevant contract month.

<a name="rollCycle"></a>
### [Roll cycles](/sysdata/futures/rolls.py): rollCycle()

Note: There is no data storage for roll cycles, they are stored only as part of [roll parameters](#rollParameters).

Roll cycles are the mechanism by which we know how to move forwards and backwards between contracts as they expire, or when working out carry trading rule forecasts. Roll cycles use the usual definition for futures months (January is F, February G, March H, and the rest of the year is JKMNQUVX, with December Z). 

<a name="rollParameters"></a>
### [Roll parameters](/sysdata/futures/rolls.py): rollParameters() and rollParametersData()

The roll parameters include all the information we need about how a given instrument rolls:

- `hold_rollcycle` and `priced_rollcycle`. The 'priced' contracts are those that we can get prices for, whereas the 'hold' cycle contracts are those we actually hold. We may hold all the priced contracts (like for equities), or only only some because of liquidity issues (eg Gold), or to keep a consistent seasonal position (i.e. CRUDEW is Winter Crude, so we only hold December).
- `roll_offset_day`: This indicates how many calendar days before a contract expires that we'd normally like to roll it. These vary from zero (Korean bonds KR3 and KR10 which you can't roll until the expiry date) up to -1100 (Eurodollar where I like to stay several years out on the curve).
- `carry_offset`: Whether we take carry from an earlier dated contract (-1, which is preferable) or a later dated contract (+1, which isn't ideal but if we hold the front contract we have no choice). This calculation is done based on the *priced* roll cycle, so for example for winter crude where the *hold* roll cycle is just 'Z' (we hold December), and the carry offset is -1 we take the previous month in the *priced* roll cycle (which is a full year FGHJKMNQUVXZ) i.e. November (whose code is 'X'). You read more in Appendix B of [my first book](www.systematicmoney.org/systematic-trading).
- `approx_expiry_offset`: How many days to shift the expiry date in a month, eg (the day of the month that a contract expires)-1. These values are just here so we can build roughly correct roll calendars (of which more later). In live trading you'd get the actual expiry date for each contract.

<a name="contractDateWithRollParameters"></a>
### [Contract date with roll parameters](/sysdata/futures/rolls.py): contractDateWithRollParameters()

Note: There is no data storage for contract dates, they are stored only as part of [futures contracts](#futuresContracts).

Combining a contract date with some roll parameters means we can answer important questions like, what is the next (or previous) contract in the priced (or held) roll cycle? What is the contract I should compare this contract to when calculating carry? On what date would I want to roll this contract?

<a name="listOfFuturesContracts"></a>
<a name="futuresContracts"></a>
### [Futures contracts](/sysdata/futures/contracts.py): futuresContracts() and futuresContractData()


The combination of a specific [instrument](#futuresInstrument) and a [contract date](#contractDate) (possibly [with roll parameters](#contractDateWithRollParameters)) is a `futuresContract`. 

`listOfFuturesContracts`: This dull class exists purely so we can generate a series of historical contracts from some roll parameters.

<a name="futuresContractPrices"></a>
### [Prices for individual futures contracts](/sysdata/futures/futures_per_contract_prices.py): futuresContractPrices(), dictFuturesContractPrices() and futuresContractPriceData()


The price data for a given contract is just stored as a DataFrame with specific column names. Notice that we store Open, High, Low, Close and Settle prices; but currently in the rest of pysystemtrade we effectively throw away everything except Settle.

`dictFuturesContractPrices`: When calculating roll calendars we work with prices from multiple contracts at once.

<a name="rollCalendar"></a>
### [Roll calendars](/sysdata/futures/roll_calendars.py): rollCalendar() and rollCalendarData()


A roll calendar is a pandas DataFrame with columns for: 

- current_contract
- next_contract
- carry_contract

Each row shows when we'd roll from holding current_contract (and using carry_contract) on to next_contract. As discussed [earlier](#roll_calendars) they can be created from a set of [roll parameters](#rollParameters) and [price data](#futuresContractPrices), or inferred from existing [multiple price data](#futuresMultiplePrices).

<a name="futuresMultiplePrices"></a>
### [Multiple prices](/sysdata/futures/multiple_prices.py): futuresMultiplePrices() and futuresMultiplePricesData()


<a name="futuresAdjustedPrices"></a>
### [Adjusted prices](/sysdata/futures/adjusted_prices.py): futuresAdjustedPrices() and futuresAdjustedPricesData()


<a name="fxPrices"></a>
### [Spot FX data](/sysdata/fx/spotfx.py): fxPrices() and fxPricesData()

Technically bugger all to do with futures, but implemented in pysystemtrade as it's required for position scaling.

## Creating your own data objects, and data storage objects; a few pointers

You should store your objects in [this directory](#/sysdata/futures) (for futures) or a new subdirectory of the [sysdata](#/sysdata/) directory (for new asset classes). Data objects and data storage objects should live in the same file. Data objects may inherit from other objects (for example for options you might want to inherit from the underlying future), but they don't have to. Data storage objects should all inherit from [baseData](#/sysdata/data.py). 

Data objects should be prefixed with the asset class if there is any potential confusion, i.e. futuresInstrument, equitiesInstrument. Data storage objects should have the same name as their data object, but with a Data suffix, eg futuresInstrumentData.

Methods you'd probably want to include in a data object:

- `create_from_dict` (`@classmethod`): Useful when reading data from a source
- `as_dict`: Useful when writing data to a source
- `create_empty` (`@classmethod`): Useful when reading data from a source if the object is unavailable, better to return one of these
- `empty`: returns True if this is an empty object

Methods you'd probably want to include in a data storage object:
 
- `keys()` and `__getitem__`. It's nice if data storage objects look like dicts. `keys()` should be mapped to `get_list_of_things_with_data`. `__getitem__` should be mapped to `get_some_data`
- `get_list_of_things_with_data`, i.e. the list of instrument codes with valid data. Should `raise NotImplementedError`
- `get_some_data`: Check to see if `is_thing_in_data` is True, then call `_get_some_data_without_checking`. If not in data, return an empty instance of the data object.
- `is_thing_in_data` i.e. is a particular instrument code in the list of codes with valid data
- `_get_some_data_without_checking`: `raise NotImplementedError`
- `delete_data_for_thing`: Check that a 'are you sure' flag is set, and that `is_thing_in_data` is True, then call `_delete_data_for_thing_without_checking`
- `_delete_data_for_thing_without_checking`: `raise NotImplementedError`
- `add_data_for_thing`: Check to see if `is_thing_in_data` is False (or that an ignore duplicates flag is set), then call `_add_data_for_thing_without_checking`
- `_add_data_for_thing_without_checking`: `raise NotImplementedError`

By the way you shouldn't really use method names like `get_list_of_things_with_data`, that's just plain silly. Instead use '`get_list_of_instruments` or what not.

Notice the use of private methods to interact with the data inside public methods that perform standard checks; these methods that actually interact with the data (rather than just mapping to other methods, or performing checks) should raise a NotImplementedError; this will then be overriden in the [data storage object for a specific data source](#specific_data_storage).

## Creating your own data storage objects for a new source

Creating your own data storage objects is trivial, assuming they are for an existing kind of data object. 

They should live in a subdirectory of [sysdata](#/sysdata), named for the data source i.e. [sysdata/arctic](#/sysdata/arctic).

Look at an existing data storage object for a different source to see which methods you'd need to implement, and to see the generic data storage object you should inherit from. Normally you'd need to override all the methods in the generic object which return `NotImplementedError`; the exception is if you have a read-only source like Quandl, or if you're working with .csv or similar files in which case I wouldn't recommend implementing delete methods.

Use the naming convention sourceNameOfGenericDataObject, i.e. `class arcticFuturesContractPriceData(futuresContractPriceData)`. 

For databases you may want to create connection objects (like [this](#/sysdata/arctic/arctic_connection.py) for Arctic) 


<a name="simData_objects">
</a>
# simData objects

The `simData` object is a compulsory part of the psystemtrade system object which runs simulations (or in live trading generates desired positions). The API required for that is laid out in the userguide, [here](#/docs/userguide.md#using-the-standard-data-objects). For maximum flexibility as of version 0.17 these objects are in turn constructed of methods that hook into data storage objects for specific sources. So for example in the default [`csvFuturesSimData`](/sysdata/csv/csv_sim_futures_data.py) the compulsory method (for futures) get_backadjusted_futures_price is hooked into an instance of [`csvFuturesAdjustedPricesData`](#csvFuturesAdjustedPricesData).

This modularity allows us to easily replace the data objects, so we could load our adjusted prices from mongo DB, or do 'back adjustment' of futures prices 'on the fly'.
